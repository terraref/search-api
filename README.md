# search-api

#MOTIVATION

Due to the large volume of data generated by the TERRA-REF project, it can be challenging for a user to locate 
specific data about a given experiment, or to find data or view images associated with a particular day or scan of 
the plot. The goal of this search api is to provide a tool that would make locating data easier. 

#DESIGN

#RESULTS PROVIDED

Depending on the query, results will be returned as a json, or as a json containing links to download datasets from 
the terra clowder instance, links to csvs, or other files. For all queries a 'count' method will be provided which shows 
the user how much data will be returned. If a particular query will return a very large result, the user can then
further refine the query to return fewer results.
